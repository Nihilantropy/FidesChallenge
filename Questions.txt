Problem:
	1 - The story service requires an authorization to POST and PUT (create and update) stories. Now the client provide his token to identify,
		the token is then sent to the users services that gives back the ok + the user info we need for the story (id and username).
		This process takes a few http request. how can we simplify that? is it possibile to move the authorization in the nginx proxy?
		is it better to try to decode the token directly in the stories-app?
