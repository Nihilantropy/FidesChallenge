Problem:
	1 - We have build an nginx proxy server. Whenever we make an http request from the frontend to the backend server we
		are forced to use the proxy route (ex. if we need to make a request to the backend-users services on port 3000
		ate the create route we have to pass at localhost/users/create, that is the nginx route that will redirect
		to the backend services. if we try to make the request directly, the browser refuse the connection)
	2 - Why npm install on some device takes a really long time?
