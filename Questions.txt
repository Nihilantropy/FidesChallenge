Problem:
	1 - Expo. The react-native frontend app is done with expo.
		When building the frontend container the application should start with
		"npx expo start", and give back a qr code to see the app from the expo go mobile application.
		This doesn't happen. The metro bundler starts at port 8081, but nothing else.
		But, if i go inside the container and manually run "npx start expo" the app will use port 8082 to
		run another service and will give the qr code, as it should.
		Any suggestion?

	2 - How would if work if we wanted to build a container to run games built with a game engine such as godot or unity?
		Is it possbible to connect the expo app to do that or the code must be written in javascript?
