# Migration Service

## Overview

The Migration Service manages database migrations using [Knex.js](http://knexjs.org/).
It runs migrations automatically when connecting to the database and exits after completing its tasks to save resources.

## How It Works

- **Knex.js Integration**: Utilizes Knex.js for defining and executing migrations.
- **Automatic Execution**: Checks for and executes pending migrations upon connection.
- **Resource Management**: Exits after completing migrations to reduce resource usage.

## Pros

- **Automation**: Reduces manual intervention and risk of human error.
- **Consistency**: Ensures the database schema matches the application codebase.
- **Version Control**: Facilitates tracking changes and rolling back if needed.
- **Simplicity**: Offers an intuitive API for managing migrations.

## Cons

- **Data Integrity Risks**: Poorly managed migrations can lead to data loss or corruption.
- **No Automatic Rollback**: Manual intervention may be needed if a migration fails.
- **Dependency on Connection**: Requires a stable database connection for migrations.

## Security Measures

1. **Regular Backup Procedures**: Automatically creates backups before migrations, allowing recovery in case of failure.
2. **Version Control**: Maintains versioning for migration scripts to ensure correct application order.
3. **Testing Environment**: Encourages using a staging environment to test migrations before production deployment.
4. **Access Control**: Limits migration service access to authorized personnel and implements role-based access. (not implemented)

## Benefits

- **Streamlined Workflow**: Automates migration processes, allowing teams to focus on development.
- **Improved Collaboration**: Versioned migrations enhance collaboration among team members.
- **Reduced Downtime**: Minimizes downtime by ensuring the database stays in sync with the application.

## Conclusion

The Migration Service simplifies managing database migrations with Knex.js, promoting consistency and
collaboration while implementing necessary security measures to safeguard data integrity.
