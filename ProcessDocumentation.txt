create git repo

create 4 branches - merged, claudio, mario, anghi

based on react-express-mysql project (link in documentation)

creating docker-compose.yml to build 3 microservices:

1 - backend server:
2 - mysql Database
3 - frontend client

Backend-side:
	1 - setup mysql container using 'knex' and 'mysql2'
	2 - setup server container using 'nodejs' and 'express'.
	3 - create a connection to the db container (same network "server-db") using knexfile and server
	
	Once the Containers are set up correctly we started working on the users microservice:
	1 - Set up the entrypoint at index.js, wait for the db to connect before starting the app.
	2 - Once the db is connected the app starts listen at port 3000. At default rout / we have a basic db check.
	3 - All users routes are prefixed with /users
	4 - Basic users routes are: /create, /login, /profile, /delete 

	The /login /profile /delete authentication is made via paseto tokens.
	Password are encrypted via bcrypt alghoritm by the client, stored in the db hashed and compared with bcrypt when the user try to login.
